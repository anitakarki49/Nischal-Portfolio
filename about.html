                    When it comes to prescribing a manual wheelchair for a client, the training process can feel overwhelming. The training begins right from the initial evaluation when selecting the appropriate device. Specifically, for this discussion, we will focus on ultra-lightweight manual wheelchairs, which weigh no more than 30 pounds (transport weight). These wheelchairs have unique features associated with the K0005 code, such as adjustable axles (vertical and horizontal), camber, and customized seat-to-floor height. It's important to educate new wheelchair users about the differences between rigid wheelchair frames and folding wheelchair frames.

                    Physical therapy is a specialized healthcare profession that helps people improve their physical function and mobility. It uses hands-on techniques, exercises, and education to reduce pain, promote healing, and enhance well-being. Physical therapists assess each person's needs and create personalized treatment plans. They work with various conditions, such as recovering from surgery, managing chronic conditions, or rehabilitating from injuries. Physical therapy aims to improve strength, flexibility, balance, and confidence, so individuals can participate fully in daily activities and enjoy a better quality of life.
